== THE PROTOCOL ==

This is a documention over how the server and client interact.
This is written before getting started with the actual server.
If things dont make sense you can change them


Data: 

The server has control over all the data that roomservice uses.
This includes:

* Login data:
    - email
    - password
    - etc.
* Map data:
    - Room:
        - position on map (x ,y)
        - heigth (w ,h)
        - comments and such
    - Individual places:
        - position on map (x ,y)
        - heigth (w ,h)
        - ratings

The map data can just be requested:
    TODO: add request form

The login data must only be supplied when we know the client was loggedin.
When requesting login and other sensitive data the client must have made a succes full login request.
When the server recieves a login request it will compare the data received ( Username, password) and when a user is found it will create an interaction instance.
This instance has a unique id which will be send back and can the be used to recieve sensitive data
